```bash
make up
```
#### 3. Bootstrap the VM
```bash
make bootstrap
```


### Tailscale Setup

The Tailscale operator requires OAuth credentials to function. These credentials need to be created manually as a Kubernetes secret. Follow these steps:

1. Create a Tailscale OAuth client:
   - Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/oauth
   - Click "Create OAuth Client"
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret


2. Set Up the Tailscale Tag
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is required for the Tailscale K8s Operator to function.
  - Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls/file
  - Add the following to your ACL file:
  ```json
	"tagOwners": {
		"tag:k8s-operator": ["autogroup:admin"],
	},
   ```
   - Save and apply the ACL changes.
